# This interface is what all your api services will be bound to by default.
# Additionally, all vxlan/tunnel and storage network traffic will go over this
# interface by default. This interface must contain an IP address.
# It is possible for hosts to have non-matching names of interfaces - these can
# be set in an inventory file per host or per group or stored separately, see
#     http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_inventory.html
# Yet another way to workaround the naming problem is to create a bond for the
# interface on all hosts and give the bond name here. Similar strategy can be
# followed for other types of interfaces.
network_interface: "enp5s0"

# This is the raw interface given to neutron as its external network port. Even
# though an IP address can exist on this interface, it will be unusable in most
# configurations. It is recommended this interface not be configured with any IP
# addresses for that reason.
